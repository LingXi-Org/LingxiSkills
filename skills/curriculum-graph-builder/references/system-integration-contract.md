# System integration contract

## Recommended runtime flow

```text
conversation / lesson event
        ↓
load learner graph candidates + learner-state signals
        ↓
curriculum-graph-builder
        ↓
validate result
        ↓
transactional patch applier (host)
        ↓
persist graph revision + audit event
        ↓
materialize KnowledgeGraphData
        ↓
KnowledgeGraphAnimation
```

Do **not** send model output directly to the visualization component before persistence. The host
must validate and apply the patch first, then return the canonical persisted snapshot.

## Input contract expected from LingxiLearn

Minimum request:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "curriculum-graph-builder-task.v1",
  "task_id": "turn_123",
  "learning_context": {
    "topic": "函数与导数",
    "source_materials": [
      {
        "source_id": "msg_123",
        "kind": "user_message",
        "content": "函数图像和导数应用之间有什么关系？"
      }
    ]
  },
  "existing_graphs": []
}
```

Production requests should normally also include:

- relevant existing graph snapshots for the authenticated learner;
- current concept signals from the active learning session;
- concept-state signals from the authoritative learner-state layer;
- upstream lesson/assessment artifacts as source materials when they contain curriculum relations.

Do not send unrelated private profile fields.

## Output handling

The Skill returns a patch, not the canonical database snapshot.

For `create_graph`:

1. host allocates `graph_id`;
2. accepts or remaps proposed node/edge IDs after collision checks;
3. applies all additions and overlay updates;
4. starts `revision=1` (or your chosen convention).

For `extend_graph` / `update_graph`:

1. require `decision.target_graph_id`;
2. compare `decision.base_revision` with the current DB revision;
3. if mismatched, reject with a revision conflict and rerun the Skill on fresh data;
4. apply patch atomically;
5. increment revision;
6. write an audit record containing `task_id`, old revision, new revision, and changed IDs.

For `no_change`, persist no graph mutation; an audit event may still be recorded.

## Persistence constraints

Recommended tables or equivalent document model:

```text
knowledge_graphs(
  graph_id, learner_id, title, domain, revision, created_at, updated_at
)
knowledge_graph_nodes(
  graph_id, node_id, label, type, importance, level, position_json,
  aliases_json, description, created_at, updated_at
)
knowledge_graph_edges(
  graph_id, edge_id, source_node_id, target_node_id,
  relation, relation_label, directed, importance, created_at, updated_at
)
knowledge_graph_learner_overlay(
  graph_id, learner_id, node_id, is_current, learning_state,
  evidence_ids_json, updated_at
)
knowledge_graph_events(
  event_id, learner_id, graph_id, task_id, base_revision, new_revision,
  patch_json, created_at
)
```

Keep curriculum structure separate from learner overlay even if the API joins them into one node
object for rendering.

## Candidate loading at scale

Do not send every graph in full forever. When the learner has large graphs, the host should first
retrieve 1–3 likely candidate graphs using graph title/domain/concept index, then send only those
snapshots to this Skill. This preserves the same contract while controlling context size.

## Frontend canonical response

Expose a persisted snapshot shaped approximately as:

```json
{
  "graph_id": "kg_math_analysis",
  "revision": 12,
  "title": "高等数学：函数与导数",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "concept.function.definition",
      "label": "函数概念",
      "type": "concept",
      "importance": 0.9,
      "is_current": false,
      "learning_state": "demonstrated"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "edge.function-to-graph",
      "source": "concept.function.definition",
      "target": "concept.function.graph",
      "relation": "foundation_for",
      "relation_label": "基础",
      "directed": true
    }
  ]
}
```
